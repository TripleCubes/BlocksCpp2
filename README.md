Voxel game written in C++

This is an old project, my coding style has changed a lot after this project. I am making a new voxel game. Checkout https://github.com/TripleCubes/Plane.

Controls:

WASD to move, SPACE to jump, F to toggle fly mode.

When in fly mode, SPACE to fly up and SHIFT to fly down.

LEFT CLICK to break block, RIGHT CLICK to place a log block.

M to toggle wireframe mode, N to toggle collisions. If collision is disabled the player will be in fly mode. To disable fly mode collision need to be enabled.

ESC to open pause menu. You can change FOV and load distance in the settings submenu.

P open a dev menu that allow terrain modification.

There is a chance you will spawn inside a tree or a mountain. If that happen you can dig your way out or disable collisions.
